      <h2>Conditions</h2>
      <p>In Career Mode, Umamusume can acquire various Conditions that affect gameplay both positively and negatively. Positive conditions are displayed orange on the trainee's full stats screen, while negative conditions are displayed blue.</p>

      <p>Positive conditions typically cannot be removed, with the exception of Practice Perfect ○, which is always removed upon the acquisition of Practice Poor. Negative conditions can be removed by visiting the Infirmary, getting the Shrine Visit during Recreation, or experiencing certain events with Hayakawa Tazuna (Tracen Reception) as a Support Card.</p>
